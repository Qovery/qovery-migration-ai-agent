# Qovery Migration AI Agent - Usage Guide

This README provides instructions on how to use the output generated by the Qovery Migration AI Agent, including how to execute the Terraform files for migrating your workload to the specified cloud service provider.

## Files Generated by the Agent

1. [main.tf](main.tf): The main Terraform configuration file.
2. [variables.tf](variables.tf): Contains variable definitions used in the main configuration.
3. One or more `Dockerfile`s: These can be reviewed and adapted before execution.
4. [cost_estimation_report.md](cost_estimation_report.md): Includes estimated costs for running the workload on the specified cloud service provider.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

1. [Terraform](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/install)
2. [Qovery Account](https://www.qovery.com/)
3. Cloud Provider Account (e.g., AWS, GCP, Azure, Scaleway...)

## Getting Started

Review and customize the files:
1. Open `main.tf` and `variables.tf` to review the configuration.
2. Optional: Check and commit the `Dockerfile`s to your source code repository if needed.
3. Review the `cost_estimation_report.md` to understand the estimated costs.

## Using the Terraform Configuration

If you're new to Terraform, here's how to use the generated configuration:

1. Initialize the Terraform working directory:
   ```
   terraform init
   ```
   This command downloads the necessary provider plugins and sets up the backend.

2. Review the planned changes:
   ```
   terraform plan
   ```
   This shows you what changes Terraform will make to your infrastructure.

3. Apply the Terraform configuration:
   ```
   terraform apply
   ```
   Terraform will show you the plan again and ask for confirmation. Type 'yes' when prompted to proceed with the creation of resources.

## Important Notes

- Always review the changes Terraform plans to make before applying them.
- Keep your Terraform state files secure, as they may contain sensitive information.
- Regularly update your Terraform version and provider plugins for security and new features.

## Understanding and Using the Cost Estimation

Before applying the Terraform configuration, carefully review the `cost_estimation_report.md` file. This report provides an estimate of the costs associated with running your workload on the specified cloud service provider. Use this information to:

- Budget for your cloud expenses
- Optimize your resource allocation
- Make informed decisions about your infrastructure setup
